Project Authors
===============

This project began as part of the MSc. Thesis of Daniel Huici Meseguer in the Master's Degree on Informatics Engineering, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain (see [this link](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/files/TFMs/BusquedaEficienteHashesSimilitudAproximada_TFM_UZ.pdf) for more details -- the original MSc. Thesis is in Spanish). The algorithms implemented in this project are taken from the following scientific publication: 

* Y. A. Malkov and D. A. Yashunin, "Efficient and Robust Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Using Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs," in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 824-836, 1 April 2020, doi: [10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2889473](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2889473). 

This publication is sometimes referred to as `MY-TPAMI-20` in the souce code.
